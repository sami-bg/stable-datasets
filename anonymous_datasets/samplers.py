"""Backend-aware samplers for :class:`AnonDataset`.

PyTorch's :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` constructs a
:class:`~torch.utils.data.RandomSampler` when ``shuffle=True`` is
passed. That sampler yields indices in a full-random permutation
regardless of the underlying storage backend. For file-backed
storage formats partitioned into shards (Arrow) or fragments
(Lance), full-random access destroys any per-shard I/O locality
the format was designed to exploit.

This module exposes samplers that yield indices in shard-aware
orderings, preserving the classical PyTorch API (``DataLoader(ds,
sampler=...)``) while providing a sampler that matches the
backend's access-pattern preferences:

    from anonymous_datasets.samplers import ShardShuffleSampler

    ds = CIFAR10(split="train", storage_format="lance")
    sampler = ShardShuffleSampler(ds, seed=42)
    loader = DataLoader(ds, batch_size=128, sampler=sampler,
                        num_workers=8, persistent_workers=True,
                        multiprocessing_context="spawn")

``DataLoader(ds, shuffle=True)`` continues to work unchanged for
users who need bit-exact full-random ordering (e.g. classification
reproduction). Samplers here are strictly opt-in.

class ShardShuffleSampler(Sampler[int]):
    """Yield indices in shard-shuffled order.

    The shard (or Lance fragment) order is randomized each epoch.
    Within each shard, indices are yielded in an order controlled
    by ``within_shard``:

    * ``"random"`` (default): indices inside a shard are themselves
      permuted. Shuffle quality is closer to full-random while
      still preserving per-shard I/O locality (all samples from
      shard *k* are emitted before any sample from shard *k+1*).
      Recommended for scientific training where shuffle quality
      matters.
    * ``"sequential"``: indices inside a shard are yielded in on-
      disk order. Maximally I/O-friendly but shuffle quality is
      coarse at the shard level. Matches the behaviour of
      ``lance.sampler.ShardedFragmentSampler``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : AnonDataset
        Must expose a ``StorageBackend``-compatible ``._backend``
        with ``num_shards`` and a way to iterate per-shard row
        ranges. Non-file-backed datasets fall back to a single
        shard covering the full dataset.
    seed : int, default 0
        Base seed; the epoch is XOR'd in via :meth:`set_epoch`.
    within_shard : {"random", "sequential"}, default "random"
        Within-shard row ordering.

    Notes
    -----
    *Epoch handling*: call :meth:`set_epoch` before each epoch when
    using :class:`~torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler`
    or any other stateful epoch pattern, so the random permutation
    differs between epochs. Mirrors PyTorch's own convention.

    *Fork-safety*: the sampler holds only integers and a seed; it
    pickles trivially and is safe to use with ``num_workers>0`` and
    ``multiprocessing_context="spawn"``.
