    """Galaxy10 DECaLS Dataset: Galaxy morphology classification with DECaLS images.

    Galaxy10 DECaLS is a much improved version of the original Galaxy10 dataset. It contains
    17,736 256x256 pixel colored galaxy images (g, r and z band) separated into 10 classes.
    The images come from DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DECaLS) and labels come from Galaxy Zoo.

    The original Galaxy10 dataset was created with Galaxy Zoo (GZ) Data Release 2 where volunteers
    classify ~270k of SDSS galaxy images. GZ later utilized images from DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys
    (DECaLS) with much better resolution and image quality. Galaxy10 DECaLS has combined all three
    (GZ DR2 with DECaLS images instead of SDSS images and DECaLS campaign a/b, c) resulting in
    ~441k of unique galaxies covered by DECaLS where ~18k of those images were selected in 10 broad
    classes using volunteer votes with more rigorous filtering.
