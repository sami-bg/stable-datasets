    SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms
    with minimal requirement on data preprocessing and formatting. It can be seen as similar in flavor to MNIST,
    but incorporates an order of magnitude more labeled data (over 600,000 digit images) and comes from a significantly harder,
    unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers
    in Google Street View images.
